biological determinism : The belief that differences we observe between groups of people, such as men and women, are explained wholly by biological causes.
biomedical model of health : The set of principles underpinning Western medical systems and practices. The biomedical model of health defines diseases objectively, in accordance with the presence of recognized symptoms, and holds that the healthy body can be restored through scientifically based medical treatment. The human body is likened to a machine that can be returned to working order with the proper repairs.
black feminism : A strand of feminist theory that highlights the multiple disadvantages of gender, class, and race that shape the experiences of nonwhite women. Black feminists reject the idea of a single, unified gender oppression that is experienced evenly by all women and argue that early feminist analysis reflected the specific concerns of white, middle-class women.

conflict theory : Argument that deviance is deliberately chosen and often political in nature.
constitutional monarchs : Kings or queens who are largely figureheads. Real power rests in the hands of other political leaders.
continuity theory : Theoretical perspective on aging that specifies that older adults fare best when they participate in activities consistent with their personality, preferences, and activities earlier in life.

Control theorists hold that criminals are rational beings who will act to maximize their own reward unless they are rendered unable to do so through either social or physical controls.
conurbation : An agglomeration of towns or cities into an unbroken urban environment.
conversation analysis : The empirical study of conversations, employing techniques drawn from ethnomethodology. Conversation analysis examines details of naturally occurring conversations to reveal the organizational principles of talk and its role in the production and reproduction of social order.

crime : Any action that contravenes the laws established by a political authority. Although we may think of criminals as a distinct subsection of the population, there are few people who have not broken the law in one way or another during their lives. While laws are formulated by state authorities, it is not unknown for those authorities to engage in criminal behavior in certain situations.
crude birthrate : A statistical measure representing the number of births within a given population per year, normally calculated as the number of births per 1,000 members. Although the crude birthrate is a useful index, it is only a general measure, because it does not specify numbers of births in relation to age distribution.
crude death rate : A statistical measure representing the number of deaths that occur annually in a given population per year, normally calculated as the number of deaths per 1,000 members. Crude death rates give a general indication of the mortality levels of a community or society, but are limited in their usefulness because they do not take into account the age distribution.

democratic elitism : A theory of the limits of democracy, which holds that in large-scale societies democratic participation is necessarily limited to the regular election of political leaders.
demographic transition : An interpretation of population change, which holds that a stable ratio of births to deaths is achieved once a certain level of economic prosperity has been reached. According to this notion, in preindustrial societies there is a rough balance between births and deaths, because population increase is kept in check by a lack of available food, by disease, or by war. In modern societies, by contrast, population equilibrium is achieved because families are moved by economic incentives to limit the number of children.
demography : The study of the size, distribution, and composition of populations.
denomination : A religious sect that has lost its revivalist dynamism and become an institutionalized body, commanding the adherence of significant numbers of people.
dependency culture : A term popularized by Charles Murray to describe individuals who rely on state welfare provision rather than entering the labor market. The dependency culture is seen as the outcome of the “paternalistic” welfare state that undermines individual ambition and people’s capacity for self-help.
dependency ratio : The ratio of people of dependent ages (children and the elderly) to people of economically active ages.
dependency theories : Marxist theories of economic development arguing that the poverty of low-income countries stems directly from their exploitation by wealthy countries and the multinational corporations that are based in wealthy countries.

developmental questions : Questions that sociologists pose when looking at the origins and path of development of social institutions from the past to the present.
deviance : Modes of action that do not conform to the norms or values held by most members of a group or society. What is regarded as deviant is as variable as the norms and values that distinguish different cultures and subcultures from one another. Forms of behavior that are highly esteemed by one group are regarded negatively by others.
deviant subculture : A subculture whose members hold values that differ substantially from those of the majority.
diaspora : The dispersal of an ethnic population from an original homeland into foreign areas, often in a forced manner or under traumatic circumstances.

direct democracy : A form of participatory democracy that allows citizens to vote directly on laws and policies.
discrimination : Behavior that denies to the members of a particular group resources or rewards that can be obtained by others. Discrimination must be distinguished from prejudice: Individuals who are prejudiced against others may not engage in discriminatory practices against them; conversely, people may act in a discriminatory fashion toward a group even though they are not prejudiced against that group.
disengagement theory : A functionalist theory of aging that holds that it is functional for society to remove people from their traditional roles when they become elderly, thereby freeing up those roles for others.
displacement : The transferring of ideas or emotions from their true source to another object.
division of labor : The specialization of work tasks, by means of which different occupations are combined within a production system. All societies have at least some rudimentary form of division of labor, especially between the tasks allocated to men and those performed by women. With the development of industrialism, the division of labor became vastly more complex than in any prior type of production system. In the modern world, the division of labor is international in scope.

economy : The system of production and exchange that provides for the material needs of individuals living in a given society. Economic institutions are of key importance in all social orders. What goes on in the economy usually influences other areas in social life. Modern economies differ substantially from traditional ones, because the majority of the population is no longer engaged in agricultural production.
egocentric : According to Jean Piaget, the characteristic quality of a child during the early years of his or her life. Egocentric thinking involves understanding objects and events in the environment solely in terms of the child’s own position.
emerging economies : Developing countries that over the past two or three decades have begun to develop a strong industrial base, such as Singapore and Hong Kong.
emigration : The movement of people out of one country in order to settle in another.
empirical investigation : Factual inquiry carried out in any area of sociological study.

entrepreneur : The owner or founder of a business firm.
environmental ecology : A concern with preserving the integrity of the physical environment in the face of the impact of modern industry and technology.

functionalism : A theoretical perspective based on the notion that social events can best be explained in terms of the functions they perform—that is, the contributions they make to the continuity of a society.
 
gender : Social expectations about behavior regarded as appropriate for the members of each sex. Gender refers not to the physical attributes distinguishing men and women but to socially formed traits of masculinity and femininity. The study of gender relations has become one of the most important areas of sociology in recent years.
gender inequality : The inequality between men and women in terms of wealth, income, and status.
gender socialization : The learning of gender roles through social factors such as schooling, the media, and family.

While in most modern societies few social obligations are involved in kinship relations extending beyond the immediate family, in other cultures kinship is of vital importance to social life.
knowledge economy : A society no longer based primarily on the production of material goods but based instead on the production of knowledge. Its emergence has been linked to the development of a broad base of consumers who are technologically literate and have made new advances in computing, entertainment, and telecommunications part of their lives.
knowledge society : Another common term for information society—a society based on the production and consumption of knowledge and information.
