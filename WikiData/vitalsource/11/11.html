The essence of the idea of community is that people feel strongly aware of belonging to it and accept its traditions. It is small-scale and intimate and is characterised by face-to-face relationships.</span></p>


<p><span><b>Concepts </b>Working definitions that are chosen or devised for use in scientific analysis. They are the way scientists define their terms for the purpose of a specific investigation. They therefore differ from dictionary definitions – these tending to have a much more general applicability.</span></p>


<p><span><b>Conflict </b>A phenomenon that occurs at two levels. Conflict at the level of interests exists where there is a difference between different parties (employers and employees, say, or workers and customers) over desired outcomes; and conflict at the level of behaviour <a id="page_0258" style="word-wrap: break-word;"></a>comes about when parties seeking different outcomes either directly clash over those differences and engage in open dispute or indirectly express their differences through such gestures as acting destructively or co-operating in a sullen or grudging manner.</span></p>


<p><span><b>Conjugal roles </b>The parts played in the household by husbands and wives.</span></p>

Direct controls involve close supervision and monitoring of activities, tight rules, highly prescribed procedures, centralised structures, low commitment culture, low trust culture, adversarial culture and a tightly bureaucratic structure and <a id="page_0259" style="word-wrap: break-word;"></a>culture. And indirect controls involve the ‘empowering’ or giving task discretion to workers, loose rules, flexible procedures, decentralised structures, high commitment culture, high trust culture, an emphasis on the mutuality of interests and a loosely bureaucratic structure and culture.</span></p>

This fits with indirect control managerial practices.</span></p>


<p><span><b>Flexibility for short-term predictability </b>The ability to make rapid changes through the use of job designs and employment policies that allow staff to be easily recruited and trained or easily laid off – as circumstances require. This fits with direct control managerial practices.</span></p>


<p><span><b>Flexible firm </b>A pattern of employment in which an organisation divides its workforce into core elements who are given security and high rewards in return for a willingness to adapt, innovate and take on new skills, and peripheral elements who are given more specific tasks and less commitment of continuing employment and skill enhancement.</span></p>

<p><span><b>Fordism </b>A pattern of industrial organisation and employment policy in which (a) mass production techniques and an associated deskilling of jobs is combined with (b) treatment of employees which recognises that workers are also consumers whose earning power and consumption attitudes – as well as their workplace efficiency – affect the success of the enterprise.</span></p>


<p><span><b>Function </b>An action or an institution has a function within a social system if it contributes towards the maintenance or adaptation of that system. A ‘dysfunction’ exists when the effect is one ‘harmful’ to that system.</span></p>

<p><span><b>Harassment </b>See <b>Sexual harassment</b>.</span></p>


<p><span><b>Human relations </b>The term is used by sociologists almost exclusively to refer to a ‘school’ of industrial sociology and to managerial styles which follow its general recommendations. The school is that associated with the Hawthorne experiments carried out in the pre-war years in America. Its emphasis is on the ways in which the ‘social needs’ of workers are met or are not met in the work situation.</span></p>


<p><span><b>Human Resource Management (HRM) </b>The HRM expression is sometimes used in a generic way to refer to all managerial activities that are concerned with employment (or ‘personnel’) aspects of work organisations. But it is also used to refer to one particular style of employment management, that involving a ‘high commitment human resourcing strategy’ (pp. 108–11). In such strategies, employers seek a close and psychologically involving relationship with workers; they build opportunities for personal development <a id="page_0261" style="word-wrap: break-word;"></a>into people’s careers; people’s employment is expected to continue over a longer-term period, potentially covering a variety of different types of work, and workers are given discretion about how tasks are carried out.

<p><span><b>Incorporation </b>The process of directing the political and economic activities of groups who may threaten a social order or system so that they operate within that order instead of threatening it. This is often associated with the ‘institutionalising’ of conflict.</span></p>


<p><span><b>Indulgency pattern </b>The ignoring of selected rule infringements by supervisors in return for those being supervised allowing supervisors to call for co-operation in matters which, strictly speaking, they could refuse.</span></p>


<p><span><b>Industrial capitalism </b>A form of society in which large-scale or complex machinery and associated technique is widely applied to the pursuit of economic efficiency on a basis whereby the capacity for work of the members of some groups is sold to others who control and organise it in such a way that the latter groups maintain relative advantage with regard to those resources which are scarce and generally valued.</span></p>


<p><span><b>Industrial relations </b>The activities and institutions associated with relationships between employers and groups of collectively organised employees.</span></p>


<p><span><b>Informal economy </b>An area of economic exchange in which work, legal or illegal, is done for gain but is not officially ‘declared’ for such purposes as taxation.</span></p>


<p><span><b>Informating work </b>ICTs can ‘record’ and hence can ‘play back’ or make visible the processes behind the operations that were once deep in the minds of the people doing that work.</span></p>


<p><span><b>Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) </b>The combination of microelectronic and computing technologies with telecommunications to manipulate human information.</span></p>


<p><span><b><a id="page_0262" style="word-wrap: break-word;"></a>Institution, social </b>A regularly occurring and therefore normal pattern of actions and relationships.</span></p>


<p><span><b>Instrumentalism </b>An orientation to work which treats it as a means towards ends other than ones to do with work itself. It typically involves a primary concern with the money to be earned.</span></p>


<p><span><b>Interpretive conceptions of social science </b>These see social science as requiring different procedures from physical sciences. The social world is regarded as a reality only accessible through the meanings developed by social actors. Understandings of social processes and the patterns within them are sought rather than explanations of social behaviour.</span></p>


<p><span><b>Jargon, work related </b>Language use and terms that are peculiar to a specific organisational, occupational or technical context.</span></p>

<p><span><b>Legends, organisational </b>Narratives about events that might or might not have happened in the organisation’s past, which have a sense of wonder about them and which point to activities that the listener is encouraged to admire or deplore.</span></p>


<p><span><b>Leisure </b>Those activities which people pursue for pleasure and which are not a necessary part of their business, employment or domestic management obligations.</span></p>


<p><span><b>Life-chances </b>The ability to gain access to scarce and valued goods and services such as a home, food and education.</span></p>


<p><span><b>Logic of corporate management </b>The logic of corporate management is one of shaping exchange relationships to satisfy the demands of the various constituencies, inside and <a id="page_0263" style="word-wrap: break-word;"></a>outside the organisation, so that continued support in terms of resources such as labour, custom, investment, supplies and legal approval is obtained and the organisation enabled to survive into the long term.</span></p>


<p><span><b>Management </b>The set of roles in an organisation and the activities associated with them which are primarily concerned with directing the organisation rather than with carrying out the tasks which make up the main work of the organisation.</span></p>


<p><span><b>Managerial manipulation of worker implicit contracts </b>The attempts by managers to ‘motivate’ workers not by ‘meeting needs’ as in classic ‘motivation theory’ but by negotiating with and persuading workers that a particular bundle of rewards that is on offer is a fair and reasonable return for the bundle of ‘efforts’ that the management is asking them to put in.</span></p>


<p><span><b>Managerialism </b>This term was once generally used to refer to the type of social system identified in the managerialist thesis. However, it is more often used nowadays to refer to approaches to public administration or government in which most problems are seen as soluble by managerial means – are seen, in effect, as administratively technical matters rather than as political, ideological or value matters.</span></p>


<p><span><b>Managerialist thesis </b>The claim that the people who manage or ‘direct’ the corporations of modern societies have taken control away from those allegedly separate interests who own wealth.</span></p>


<p><span><b>Methodology </b>A term often misused to refer to research techniques and which, more properly, refers to the philosophical issues raised by the attempt to investigate the world scientifically.</span></p>


<p><span><b>Micropolitics </b>The political processes that occur within organisations as individuals, groups and organisational ‘sub-units’ compete for access to scarce and valued material and symbolic resources.</span></p>

It may be intra-generational (the individual changes their position within their own life career) or inter-generational (where the individual moves into a position which differs from that of their parents). Movement may be upwards or downwards.</span></p>


<p><span><b>Models </b>Analytical schemes which simplify reality by selecting certain phenomena and suggesting particular relationships between them.</span></p>


<p><span><b>Modernism </b>An approach to dealing with the world based on the application of rational and scientific analysis to social, political, economic and industrial institutions in the belief that this can lead to greater human control over the world and thus bring about general progress in the condition of humankind.</span></p>

<p><span><b>Narratives and stories </b>Accounts of the world which follow a basic form of ‘this, then that, then that’ and which, when applied to human affairs, typically take on a more <a id="page_0264" style="word-wrap: break-word;"></a>developed story-like form involving characters with interests, motives, emotions and moralities.</span></p>


<p><span><b>Negotiated order </b>The pattern of activities which emerge over time as an outcome of the interplay of the various interests, understandings, reactions and initiatives of the individuals and groups involved in an organisation.</span></p>


<p><span><b>Non-standard employment </b>Employment in which contracts between employers and employees are short-term and unstable with the worker taking part-time, temporary and, sometimes, multiple jobs – the work sometimes being at home rather than in an organisationally located workplace and there being little by way of employment benefits.

<p><span><b><a id="page_0265" style="word-wrap: break-word;"></a>Official and unofficial aspects of organisations </b>Official aspects of organisations are the rules, values and activities that are part of the formally managerial-sanctioned policies and procedures. Unofficial aspects are the rules, values and activities that people at all levels in the organisation develop but which do not have formal managerial sanction.</span></p>


<p><span><b>Official control apparatus of an organisation </b>The set of roles, rules, structures, value statements, cultural symbols, rituals and procedures managerially designed to co-ordinate and control work activities.</span></p>

See also <b>Radical pluralist frame of reference</b>.</span></p>


<p><span><b>Political economy </b>Social scientific approaches which emphasise the power dimensions of social life and how these, together with the ways in which production is organised, influence whatever particular phenomena are being considered.</span></p>

<p><span><b>Positivism </b>The term is generally used to refer to a position which sees social science and the natural or physical sciences as equivalent and therefore as amenable to the same basic kind of investigative procedure. It sees the social world as an objective reality external to those who study it and seeks explanations in the form of general theories or covering laws which can be used to make predictions. For some, the essence of the positivism is the idea of social science as a means of predicting and therefore the controlling of social institutions and events.</span></p>

<p><span><b>Problematic, A </b>This is similar to a paradigm (above) but the term emphasises the role of certain problems or issues which give a focus to the process of selecting phenomena to concentrate on. A problematic is thus a set of linked concepts focusing on particular problems or issues.</span></p>


<p><span><b>Productive co-operation </b>The achievement, in the light of the tendency of people involved in organisations to have their own projects, interests and priorities, of a degree of working together that ensures that tasks carried out in the organisation’s name are fulfilled to sufficient a level to enable the organisation to continue in existence.</span></p>


<p><span><b><a id="page_0267" style="word-wrap: break-word;"></a>Professionalisation </b>A process followed by certain occupations to increase its members’ status, relative autonomy and rewards and influence through such activities as setting up a professional body to control entry and practice, establishing codes of conduct, making claims of altruism and a key role in serving the community.</span></p>


<p><span><b>Professions </b>Occupations which have been relatively successful in gaining high status and autonomy in certain societies on the basis of a claimed specialist expertise over which they have gained a degree of monopoly control.</span></p>


<p><span><b>Proletarianisation </b>A trend whereby members of a ‘middle-class’ occupational group move downwards in the class and status hierarchy, finding themselves located in a position more like that of working-class rather than middle-class people.</span></p>


<p><span><b>Proletariat </b>This category, in the basic Marxian scheme, includes all of those who lack sufficient capital upon which they can subsist and who, therefore, are forced to ‘sell their labour power’ (capacity to work) on the market.</span></p>


<p><span><b>Psychologism </b>A tendency to explain social behaviour solely in terms of the psychological characteristics of individuals.</span></p>
