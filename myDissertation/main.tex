\bibliographystyle{amsplain}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% The line above specify a BibTeX style which controls 
%% the appearance of the bibliography and how citations to
%% the bibliography within the text will work.  Other options beside 
%% amsplain are available. For instance
%%
%% \bibliographystyle{plain}
%%
%% which resembles amsplain but is less elaborate. 
%%
%% You could replace the line above by the following three lines
%%
%% \usepackage{natbib}
%% \bibliographystyle{plainnat}
%% \usepackage{uscnatbib}
%%
%% to get an author-date system recommended by the Chicago 
%% Manual of Style. You have to get the package uscnatbib.sty 
%% from the Graduate School.
%%
%% A second possibility is to replace the line above by
%%
%% \usepackage[style=uscnumeric]{biblatex}
%% \bibliography{\jobname}
%%
%% or by
%%
%% \usepackage[style=uscauthoryear]{biblatex}
%% \bibliography{\jobname}
%%
%% The first of these two alternatives is like \bibliographystyle{plain}
%% while the second produces an author-date sytem recommended by the 
%% Chicago Manual of Style.  You have to download the supporting files
%%
%% uscnumeric.bbx
%% uscnumeric.cbx
%%
%%    or
%%
%% uscauthoryear.bbx
%% uscauthoryear.cbx
%%
%% from the Graduate School.
%%
%% These two options use the biblatex.sty package, which is included with 
%% most up-to-date LaTeX installations.  This package provides a powerful
%% an flexible alternative to the traditional way BibTeX has been used.
%% 
%% A third possibility is to use the amsrefs package,  an 
%% very attractive alternative to BibTeX. To use this possibility
%% replace the \bibliographystyle{amsplain} with the following lines 
%%
%% \usepackage{uscamsrefs}
%%
%%     or
%%
%% \usepackage[author-year]{uscamsrefs}
%%
%% The first alternative produces a bibliography like that produced
%% by \bibliographystyle{amsplain} while the second produces an author-date
%% system recommended by the Chicago Manual of Style. To use this option
%% you have to download the file 
%% 
%% uscamsref.sty
%%
%% from the Graduate School.
%%
%% The three systems suggested above that to conform the Chicago Manual of Style
%% provide several different commands for you to use in the text when
%% citing an item in your bibliography.  The three systems do this job
%% differently.
%%
%% 
%%In any case, this  is a good spot to ask LaTeX to load what it needs to handle
%% literature citations and to layout the bibliography.

\acknowledgments{acknowledge/ack} %% This calls the file thanks.tex 
%% This is optional       %% where you have put your 
                          %%acknowledgments.

%\dedication{dedication}   %% Calls dedication.tex

\makeLoT               %% Issue this command if your work has

\makeLoF               %% works the same way but for figures.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%  Finally, here is the meat.  The idea is to compose a 
%%  .tex file for each section of your thesis or dissertation.  
%%  Then use LaTeX's \include command to put them all together.  
%%  Doing it this way makes it easier to change the order of 
%%  exposition as your writing is in progress.  Also it
%%  makes it easy to print out just one section. The \include
%%  command always starts a new page. So every section would 
%%  start on a new page.  If you would like for sections just
%%  to continue, after the appropriate vertical space, on the
%%  current page, then use the \input command instead of the 
%%  \include command.
