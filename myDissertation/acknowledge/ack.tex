This work would not have been done without the help of so many people in so many ways. First of all I want to express my sincere gratitude and deep regards to my adviser, Michael N. Huhns. His knowledge and genuine enthusiasm for research is unmatched. He is a wonderful adviser and great mentor, who motivated and guided me all the way along during my Ph.D. studies. I'm thankful to my dissertation committee members: Kuldar Taveter, Jos{\'e} Vidal, Manton Matthews and Munindar Singh for their ongoing support and great suggestions on my work. Besides, Kuldar Taveter provided me opportunities to collaborate and it would not be possible to turn our work into published pieces without him. I must thank Barbara Ulrich, Randi Baldwin and Sherri Altizer, who prepared all my paperwork needed for graduation.

I received the help of many friends while I was producing this work. Discussion with them intrigued me and helped me to relax. Special thanks to Mingzhe Du who provided me with not only spiritual support, but also technical support while I was struggling with different kinds of problems.  

Lastly, I would like to pay tribute to my family. My parents and grandma encouraged me to go on this path to pursue the knowledge that I longed for. Also to my uncle, who provided me a better study environment before going to the college, otherwise I won't be able to end up here.
